## The following analysis utilizes a digital media store database, Chinook, downloaded from Kaggle.

# I answered the following questions:

---Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS FullName, CustomerID, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';


--Show only the Customers from Brazil

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';


--Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName as FullName, InvoiceId, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices inv

LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE BillingCountry = 'Brazil';
