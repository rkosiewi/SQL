## The following analysis utilizes a digital media store database, Chinook, downloaded from Kaggle.

# I answered the following questions:

-- 1.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS FullName, CustomerID, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';


-- 2.Show only the Customers from Brazil

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';


-- 3.Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName as FullName, InvoiceId, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices inv

LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE BillingCountry = 'Brazil';


-- 4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents

SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title LIKE '%Agent';


-- 5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;


-- 6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.FirstName || ' ' || emp.LastName AS SA_FullName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees emp

JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepid

JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId;


-- 7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT inv.Total, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.LastName, emp.FirstName

FROM chinook.invoices inv

JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerID

JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId;


-- 8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


-- 9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT sum(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


-- 10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT ini.InvoiceLineId, tks.Name

FROM chinook.invoice_items ini

LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks tks
ON ini.TrackId = tks.TrackId;


-- 11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.


SELECT t.Name as Track, art.name as Artist,i.InvoiceLineId  
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i

LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID= t.TrackID

INNER JOIN chinook.albums al
ON al.AlbumID= t.AlbumID

LEFT JOIN chinook.artists art
ON art.ArtistID= al.ArtistID;


-- 12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.Name as Track, al.Title as Album, m.Name as Media_Type, g.Name as Genre
FROM chinook.tracks t

LEFT JOIN chinook.albums al
ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId

INNER JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON t.MediaTypeId = m.MediaTypeId

INNER JOIN chinook.genres g
ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId;


--  13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT emp.FirstName || " " || emp.LastName AS Sales_agent, ROUND(sum(inv.Total),2) as Total
FROM chinook.employees emp

LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId

LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId

GROUP BY Sales_agent;


-- 14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName || " " || emp.LastName AS Name, ROUND(sum(Total),2) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.employees emp

JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId

JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' AND InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'

GROUP BY Name
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 1;
