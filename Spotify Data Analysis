# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.

# The following data was utilized in my analysis using SQL

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#The data was imported into SQL using a CSV file and I answered the following questions:

#1. What is the average danceability by artist and track?

SELECT artist_name,track_name, avg(danceability)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY artist_name, track_name;


#2. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?

SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC;


#3. What artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name, max(duration_ms)
FROM Spotifydata;


#4. What's the average danceability for the 10 most songs?

SELECT track_name, avg(danceability) AS dance_time
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY dance_time DESC
LIMIT 10;


#5. What are the bottom 10 songs based on energy? What is their tempo?

SELECT track_name, energy, tempo
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy;
